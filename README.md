# Guadaloop-Starter-Projects
Repository for Guadaloop Gen 2 Starter Projects

# How to Add your Projects to this repository

1. Clone repository to your computer
2. Create a branch off the main branch with: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. work on your project, within that branch. i.e. add all your files to that branch.
4. While working on your project, remember to save all your progress by frequently staging your changes and committing them.
5. After you have finished your project, stage and commit all your changes and create a remote branch (if you haven't already) with this command: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>`
6. Create a pull request to merge your changes to main and assign me as a reviewer.
7. I will then look over your code and give you feedback.
